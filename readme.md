# Yoto Sample Apps

We’ve created some sample apps to help you get started with the Yoto API and your favorite language/framework.

## Getting Started

Before running any of the sample apps, you'll need a Yoto Client ID and Client Secret.

Each sample app has its own README with specific instructions on how to run it in its own directory.
